        <p>
            Many architectural wonders were built during the British Era in India. The British architecture
            left an imprint of legacy of the British Empire. Edwin Landseer Lutyens, a British architect laid
            the foundation of a new style of architecture for New Delhi, the captial of the British Empire.
            Between 1912 and 1931, Lutyens planned and designed the city using elements of British, Mughal and
            Buddhist style of architecture. Following are some of the architectural marvels constructed during
            the mordern period.
